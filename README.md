# DigitWise: Handwritten Digit Recognition App (Random Forest Edition)

A lightweight web application that recognizes handwritten digits (0–9) drawn by the user using a classical Machine Learning model — Random Forest Classifier.

---

## Overview

DigitWise allows you to draw a digit on a canvas and predicts the digit using a trained Random Forest model. The app is built with **Streamlit**, enabling a simple and interactive interface.

### Goal
To demonstrate how classical ML algorithms (Random Forest) can be applied to image-based digit classification using the UCI Digits dataset.
